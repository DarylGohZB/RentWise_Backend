FROM mysql:8.0

# This Dockerfile is intentionally minimal. We rely on the official MySQL image
# entrypoint which executes any scripts placed in /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d

# If you need custom initialization logic, add it here or place scripts in
# ./schema and they will be mounted into the container by docker-compose.
